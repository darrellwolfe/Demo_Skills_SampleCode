Thank you Darrell. I see where it is all coming from now.

There are a few in the list that could be changed over if ok with everyone else.  I highlighted in yellow what I thought needed a changed permit category.


For instance:

Anything with the words “Fire Damage” or “Fire Repair” should be Mandatory Reviews for us. 
    Those will most likely be remodel permit situations for us and involve a bit more of a value change.

Outbuilding/Garage Permits are just meant for Sheds, Pole Buildings, Shops, Garages, Detached Garages, etc., 
    so “Buildings,” not remodel type items.



DEMOS—Demo of full house or other structures are Mandatory Reviews, 
    but Demo of interior walls (there is also usually a remodel permit on top of these), decks, or other minor 
    demo things are not Mandatory Reviews. They can be moved into the Addition/Alt/Remodel category.

Row 315 “Town House” should be New Dwelling permit. 
    Also anything with Condo, Townhouse, Townhome, Duplex, Triplex, Fourplex should be under “New Dwelling” permit.


Also, I don’t know about Terry, but typically when we see Window and Door Replacement permits, 
    those are also more of a Remodel type situation that we should “Visit” 
    because 9 times out of 10 there are doing significant remodel work 
    and it involves a larger dollar change in appraised value.  
    I wish the “Roof/Siding/Wind/Mech” Permits could be changed to “Roof/Mech/Misc” Permit category. 
    
    Those are typically far less in value and would not necessarily require a visit 
    until the next scheduled Reval visit. Just my two cents worth, not a huge deal.


               
                Thanks for sharing your list. Makes a lot more sense now!
