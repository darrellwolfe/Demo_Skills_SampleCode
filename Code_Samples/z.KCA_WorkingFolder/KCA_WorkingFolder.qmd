# Kootenai County Assessor's Office - Working Folder

This folder is where I'm working on projects that are not ready to get pushed to the Main Repo yet. We all agreed that pushing once a week would be cleaner for all involved, this way when we push updates everyone can read the one clean update of the final project rather than hundreds of mini-updates. I cannot stand the idea of leaving work on my local PC even for one day, so I will push to my Private Codebase frequently and then map this to Main once a week.
