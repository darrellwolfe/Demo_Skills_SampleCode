# National Market Markers

This repository is dedicated to analyzing various national market trends using data-driven approaches. It contains data files, scripts, reference screenshots, images from analysis, and final reports generated from the analyses.

## Repository Structure

- **_dataframes**: This folder contains all data files used in the analyses, such as CSV, Excel files, and SQL dumps. Data is organized based on the analysis topic.

- **_images**: Stores reference screenshots for sourcing data and visual outputs from our analyses, including charts, graphs, and other visualizations. Images are named descriptively to reflect the content and analysis they belong to.

- **_Scripts**: Contains all scripts used for data manipulation and analysis. The scripts are organized by analysis topic, ensuring that all related scripts (Python, R, SQL) are grouped together under the same topic name (e.g., `GasPrices.py`, `GasPrices.r`, `GasPrices.sql`).

- **Final_Reports**: Houses `.qmd` files that provide detailed reports for each analysis. These reports summarize findings, methodologies, and contain links to the corresponding scripts and images.
