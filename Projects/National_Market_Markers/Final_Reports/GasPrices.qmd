# Gas Prices in USA, historical analysis

This report is intended to review gas prices in the USA historically for comparison against various claims. 

One such claim is that the sitting US President has a direct affect on gas prices.

## Data from the EIA - US Energy Information Administration

This dataframe set `GasPrices_eia_prices_1970_2022` comes from the EIA website as a downloadable CSV. 

The [EIA][1] provides an FAQ for using the data, which includes instructions to download the [CSV][2] and for a reference [Excel][3] document that helps with conversion.

> "To obtain the historical prices from the SEDS data, use the CSV file for All States—Prices. In the file, the code for gasoline prices for the transportation sector, in `$/MMBtu`, is: State Abbreviation (in column A) and `MGACD` (in column B). For example, the code for Alaska is `AK—MGACD`. Those prices, in $/MMBtu, can be converted to approximate dollars per gallon using the heat contents in Table A3 Petroleum consumption and fuel ethanol. There are 42 U.S. gallons in a barrel."

The CSV is downloaded from 
> Section: Prices and expenditures > Subsection: All price and expenditure estimates >    SubSubsection: Prices > 1970-2022 > XLSX CSV ZIP

The following shows the barrel prices falling sharply well before 2016's national election, and remaining relatively stable until after the pandemic crashes of 2020.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Path to the CSV file
file_path = 'C:/Users/dwolfe/Documents/Demo_Skills_SampleCode/Projects/National_Market_Markers/_dataframes/GasPrices_eia_prices_1970_2022.csv'

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter rows where 'MSN' column contains 'MGACD'
filtered_df = df[df['MSN'].str.contains('MGACD', case=False, na=False)]

# Calculate the average for each year for the filtered data
average_prices = filtered_df.iloc[:, 3:].mean()  # Assumes year data starts at the 4th column

# Create a line plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))  # Set the figure size
plt.plot(average_prices.index, average_prices.values, marker='o')  # Plot the average prices
plt.title('Average Gas Prices Over Years for MGACD')  # Add a title
plt.xlabel('Year')  # Add x-axis label
plt.ylabel('Average Price')  # Add y-axis label
plt.grid(True)  # Add a grid
plt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout to make room for the rotated x-axis labels
plt.show()  # Display the plot
